Xfce-4.8pre2 was [announced][1] yesterday. Gentoo has it available already thanks to the work of Samuli (ssuominen). The pre1 version was available with 0day bumps too, that proved to have the normal beta release "issues", there are many bugs fixed in pre2 ([ChangeLog][2]). I saw several Gentoo users participating on the Xfce bugtracker, thanks. If you are of the type to test and report bugs, feel free to upgrade to 4.8pre2 and help make 4.8 final a solid release by participating upstream ([bug tracker][3]).

The final 4.8 release is scheduled for January 16th, 2011. The Gentoo Xfce team will continue to bring you 0day bumps if possible. The 4.8 series will not hit the Gentoo stable tree until after the final release.
