It is surprisingly hard to find *this* fuse diagram online. I actually had the diagram in the glove box of my car but it is cold out and I didn't want to sit outside reading the manual. I went in trying to find the source of my rear window defroster failure and found the fuse blown and &#8220;melted&#8221; to the plastic. I broke the fuse when I removed it and then replaced it with a spare fuse. It looks like the previous owner used a 30A when it should have been 25A. Anyway, works like a charm now &#8211; ready for winter.
