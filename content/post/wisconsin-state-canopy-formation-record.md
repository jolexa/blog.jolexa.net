Over the past weekend, I was at [Sky Knights][1] skydiving drop zone near [Milwaukee, WI][2]. The main event was the [**c**anopy **r**elative **w**ork (CRW)][3] state record attempts. I had only participated in approximately 25 CRW jumps before this, but I was able to add another 13 jumps this weekend. The previous state record for CRW in Wisconsin was 14 and this year we completed a 25 way diamond on our second attempt to set the new record. I was able to jump with eight CRW world record holders which was awesome and really helped me improve.
