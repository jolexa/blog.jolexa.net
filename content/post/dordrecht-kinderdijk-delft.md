I went to Dordrecht for just a short time, a very small town. We made a mistake on the waterbus that led us to walking around the town for a few hours until we could get to the intended goal of Kinderdijk. Kinderdijk is the home of the famous windmills that Holland is known for. The windmills are preserved and still working but not used since the invention of the electric pump. We had to go see the windmills and get *the* picture...

Then I went to Delft for one night and just relaxed at the hostel for the night and bummed around inside while it was raining. Delft is home of the famous hand painted blue and white china &#8211; &#8220;delftware&#8221;. I did manage to stroll around the town briefly (not much to see by foot though). Delft has all the canals and architecture that Amsterdam has but very small and different culture.
