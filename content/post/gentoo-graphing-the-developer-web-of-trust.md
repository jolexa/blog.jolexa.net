*&#8220;Nothing gets people&#8217;s interest peaked like colorful graphics. Therefore, graphing the web of trust in your local area as you build it can help motivate people to participate as well as giving everyone a clear sense of what&#8217;s being accomplished as things progress.&#8221;*

I graphed the [Gentoo Developer Web of Trust][1], as motivated by the (outdated) [Debian Web of Trust][2].

Graph (same as link above) &#8211; Redrawn weekly : <http://qa-reports.gentoo.org/output/wot-graph.png>

Enjoy.
