> The advantage of Open Source is not the price, it’s its open nature. Knowledge is freedom and Open Source is all about freedom, no closed source alternative can match that. But this not something so obvious when you’re new to Open Source.  &#8211;Oliver Fourdan (Creator of [Xfce][1]) [[source][2]]
