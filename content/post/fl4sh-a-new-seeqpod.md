It has been months since seeqpod was [shutdown][1]. I have finally found [fl4sh.com][2]. I took this [recommendation/review][3] and went ahead and signed up for an account. After all, I needed a [pandora][4] replacement after they limited free listening to 40 hours per month! Now, if I only had my saved seeqpod playlists! Oh well, rock on.
