I'm not going to say anything bad about GoDaddy. You can read all that stuff at [NoDaddy][1]. <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I browsed around and looked at a few registrar's that people recommended. The top 3 that I found recommended were [name.com][2], [namecheap.com][3], and [internet.bs][4]. I settled on internet.bs because of the free private whois offerings (others have this too), the free one year extension, and most importantly the fact that they responded to me via email within 5 minutes!

The transfer was really smooth and I was able to complete the transfer within 1 day. So, I've only been with internet.bs for a few days but so far I do like their services. Hopefully they continues to impress me.
