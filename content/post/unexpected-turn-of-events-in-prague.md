This adventure of mine is really turning into an adventure..

I&#8217;m staying in Prague for another month. I&#8217;m working at a hostel as a bartender and getting my own private room and one/two meals per day. I have two consecutive days off per week and I plan on going on overnight trips to other cities in Czech. I&#8217;ve basically invalidated the rest of my planning for the next month or two but I&#8217;ll figure that out later..

Welcome to my office&#8230;
