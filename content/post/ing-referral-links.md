After some searching for a new online savings account, I settled on [ING Direct][1]. A few reasons include a competitive interest rate, good user interface, ability to create sub-accounts (I use these for different savings goals), & most importantly a $25 bonus from using some one else's referral link. It took me until the 4th page on google to find a working link.

So, if you are looking for a new savings account or just a quick and easy $25 dollars, do consider using these below. However, you must fund the account with an initial deposit of $250+. As a bonus, you get $25 (an immediate 10% return ðŸ˜‰ ) and I get $10.

Leave a comment if they appear to be all used up. I will try to monitor it and refresh them as needed.

PS. Welcome to the first post in my new financial catagory. I apologize if it bores some of my regular readers but I plan to journal some of my insights, goals, and financial mishaps here.
