Just a quick note to say that <http://sources.gentoo.org/>, our web view for source repositories, has moved to a new host a few days ago. Some of you have noted on it being &#8220;faster&#8221; ðŸ˜‰ This was the goal as it is now on much improved hardware. (Thanks goto our Gentoo Linux [sponsors][1] for providing hardware/colocation)

The templates for that site are hosted at [gentoo-viewvc-templates.git][2] repo. If you want to make any improvements, I can evaluate. Please submit requests/patches to bugs.gentoo.org, not me directly.
