About a year ago, I was writing about my Round the World trip [winding down][1] and [returning to the workforce][2], my career. I&#8217;ve gone through a whole bunch of &#8216;things&#8217; in the past year which mostly remind me that 1) life is short and random, and 2) I can do anything I want to.

On the first topic, I did a number to my spine and compressed L1, L2 vertebrae. About a 3 month resting period and I&#8217;m still recovering from that one, probably will be for the rest of my life. Oh, I broke my wrist too. All this from a little skydiving accident, which I&#8217;ll spare the details. I&#8217;m back at the gym, eating well, and really inspired to build myself better than I was. I count my lucky stars that I&#8217;m able to make a full recovery. Ergo, life is short and random. However, it really opened up my viewpoints on many of life&#8217;s topics and made me realize all the calculated risks that humans take everyday.

Speaking of risks, enter new job&#8230;

A year ago, I was writing about starting a new job, getting a new apartment, and new car all within two weeks. Now I&#8217;m able to say that I&#8217;m at it again. While it may not be the same as traveling to a new country every few weeks, it is still very exciting. In December, I&#8217;ll be starting a new role at a new company, [SPS Commerce][3]. It was great working at [Reeher][4], and I have nothing but good things to say about the company and the people. I&#8217;m also moving, but only 15 minutes away.

I&#8217;m thrilled to accelerate my career and position myself where I was prior to my career break started. It hasn&#8217;t been exactly what I envisioned, but does anything work out like we think? Now, for all the naysayers that say a career-break on your mid-20s resume is career suicide&#8230; I challenge you to go for your dreams because life is short and you can do anything you want to.
