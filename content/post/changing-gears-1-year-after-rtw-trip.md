About a year ago, I was writing about my Round the World trip [winding down][1] and [returning to the workforce][2], my career. I've gone through a whole bunch of 'things' in the past year which mostly remind me that 1) life is short and random, and 2) I can do anything I want to.

On the first topic, I did a number to my spine and compressed L1, L2 vertebrae. About a 3 month resting period and I'm still recovering from that one, probably will be for the rest of my life. Oh, I broke my wrist too. All this from a little skydiving accident, which I'll spare the details. I'm back at the gym, eating well, and really inspired to build myself better than I was. I count my lucky stars that I'm able to make a full recovery. Ergo, life is short and random. However, it really opened up my viewpoints on many of life's topics and made me realize all the calculated risks that humans take everyday.

Speaking of risks, enter new job...

A year ago, I was writing about starting a new job, getting a new apartment, and new car all within two weeks. Now I'm able to say that I'm at it again. While it may not be the same as traveling to a new country every few weeks, it is still very exciting. In December, I'll be starting a new role at a new company, [SPS Commerce][3]. It was great working at [Reeher][4], and I have nothing but good things to say about the company and the people. I'm also moving, but only 15 minutes away.

I'm thrilled to accelerate my career and position myself where I was prior to my career break started. It hasn't been exactly what I envisioned, but does anything work out like we think? Now, for all the naysayers that say a career-break on your mid-20s resume is career suicide... I challenge you to go for your dreams because life is short and you can do anything you want to.
