The release of Xfce-4.6.1 was [announced][1] approximately 36 hours ago on the xfce-announce mailing list. It is my pleasure to say that it is now in the Gentoo tree as well. You can find a shiny 4.6.1 bugfix release upon your next &#8211;sync.

Due to the [number of bugfixes][2] by the Xfce team upstream, the Gentoo Xfce team has decided to remove 4.6.0 related ebuilds and focus on bringing 4.6.1 to the stable tree. As always, please test and report bugs. Upstream issues should goto the [Xfce bug tracker][3].
