Spring Break trip this year was to [Montpellier, France.][1]

I was in France for 8 days. The whole point of the trip was to see Kelli. She showed me around the city and was my personal tour guide. French towns are very interesting, small streets, 6-spoked intersections (non-right angles), old buildings, etc. I will eventually post pictures of the trip. Overall, great trip. My only complaints are that it wasn&#8217;t long enough and everyone there smokes cigarettes.
