The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">LAST LEG</span> of my 14 MONTH RTW trip was in Japan. I don't know what to think of Japan, it is a magnificently crazy place (Tokyo &#8211; biggest city in world), a majestic countryside (Kyoto, Nikko, Fujisan, Nara, etc) and everything in between. I'm glad I went there because I have no background history with &#8220;eastern countries&#8221; and their culture. It was a humbling experience to got Hiroshima, for sure. The sushi and fish was great (naturally). I think I tried the most new-to-me foods there, such as beef tongue, pig intestine, raw squid/octopus, & eel off the top of my head. The best part of Japan was that I got to see my older cousin for the first time in 8+ years and meet his lovely girlfriend for the first time ever. The weirdest thing I did in Tokyo was goto a [maid caf√©][1] in Akihabara. If you are interested, I have pictures of Japan, [here][2], (but not the maid cafe, ha). I made it back to USA soil for the first time in 424 days on December 8, it has been a whirlwind of the past two weeks (more on that later).

&#8220;Nara, Japan: where even the wild deer bow to you.&#8221;
