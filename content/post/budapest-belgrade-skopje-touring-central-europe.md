I was in Budapest for 11 days. I couchsurfed there and it is longer than I normally stay at someone's house, by far. So, thanks Paul! Budapest was nice, reminded me much of Prague. While, I was there I visited a Turkish Bath, that was very interesting experience. Imagine, a social, public "hot tub & sauna" with water naturally hot. I found a newly minted Crossfit gym, [RC Duna][1], that opened up it's doors for a traveller, so gracious. Even though I didn't get to see the Opera in Vienna, I went to the Opera house in Budapest. It was my first time seeing a ballet, *The Nutcracker*. There were Christmas markets in Budapest too. I actually liked the Budapest ones more so than the Viennese markets. I also helped to organize the first (known) Hungarian Gentoo Linux Beer Meeting <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Then I took a train to Belgrade, Serbia. The train was 8+ hours. I couchsurfed again for 3 nights. Had some wonderful chats with my host, Ljubica. She learned about US things, I learned about Serbian things, just what you could hope for, a cultural exchange via couchsurfing. I was her first US guest. Later on, an Argentinian fellow stayed there too and we had conversations about worldly topics, like *"why are borders so important and do we need them?"* and *"speculating why Belgium's [lack of government][2] even worked."* Then perhaps, the best part, I got to try authentic [*mate*][3]. In my opinion, there wasn't much to actually see in Belgrade during the winter, I did walk around and went to the fortress. Otherwise, nursed my head cold which I got on the train.

I took the bus to Skopje, FYROM. I stayed in Skopje for 3 nights at a nice independent hostel, [Shanti Hostel][4] (recommended). I walked around the center (not much to see), walked through the old bazaar, and ate some good food. The dishes in Central Europe include lots of meat. I embarked on a mission to find the semi-finalist entry for the next 7 wonders of the world, [Vrelo Cave][5], but I got lost and took a 10km hike along the river, it was spectacular! And peaceful. Perfect really. I wanted to see what was at the end of the trail, but eventually turned around because it didn't end. On the way back, I slipped and came within feet of going in the drink. As my legs straddled a tree and my feet went through the branches that were clearly meant to handle no weight, I used that split second to be thankful. I used the next second to watch something black go *bounce*, ..., *bounce*, *SPLASH*. It is funny how you can go from thankful to cursing about your camera in the river so quickly. I got up, looked around and thought about how I got off the path, dang. Being the frugal man I am, I continued off the path and went searching for my camera. Well, that was bad because I slipped again. As I was sliding on my ass and grabbing branches, I eventually stopped. It was at this point, I knew my camera was gone since I could see the battery popped out and was in the water. Le sigh. C'est la vie.

So, no pictures, friends. I had a few hundred pictures that I didn't upload and they are gone. I might buy a camera again but for now, you will just have to take my word for it. My Mom says she will send me a disposable camera ðŸ˜€ ha.

*I'm off to Greece at 6am...*
