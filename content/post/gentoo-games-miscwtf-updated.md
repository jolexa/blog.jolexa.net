Ok, I normally would not write about a version bump...but I like this one =)

Everyone's most favorite utility to decipher slang on the internet has been updated. I took over maintainer-ship of this package because I noticed that the homepage of this ebuild pointed to a very non-descrip place and I wanted to find out who actually wrote this thing. I found out that it was a <a href="http://netbsd.org/" target="_blank">NetBSD</a> utility and even better, it gets updated regularly. I now have a cron job alerting me if there is updates (thanks to Patrick at [Gentoo Experimental][1] for providing webspace and a easy to use devel area). So I will wait for more updates and release new version bumps when the time is right. Is there any acronym that you want to see in there?
