*Ahem, let me dust this this off&#8230;*

For those keeping track at home, it has been over 7 months since writing on this thing. Yup, new job, new car, new apartment after I got back. That was fun, and &#8220;settling&#8221; in again has kept me busy. I&#8217;ve also been enjoying the [short] summer that we have.

The most common question that people ask me now is &#8220;When are you leaving again?&#8221; &#8211; I guess there must be something in my eyes when I tell the travel story&#8230;ha. Nothing planned.

As far as tech goes, I&#8217;ve been digging into [Chef][1] for my *IT automation needs*. I simply can&#8217;t imagine a workplace without automation these days. I would show some github stats here but, (said every Ops engineer that I know,) most everything is behind private repo(s). I&#8217;m learning new technologies I haven&#8217;t used before and wearing many hats at a startup. I know the breadth of skills can only help in the long run. I haven&#8217;t worked on Gentoo Linux in awhile. I&#8217;m trying to find something there that interests me but after your tech belongings have been commoditized/optimized for lightweight travel, motivation is lacking. Keeping up with emerging tech is still fun, though.
