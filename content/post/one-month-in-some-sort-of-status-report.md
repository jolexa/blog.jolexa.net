I&#8217;d like to write some sort of public status report or brain dump of what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;ve been on-the-road for one month of the *planned* 12 months and just &#8220;Living the Dream&#8221; as many of the fellow travelers would say. I&#8217;ve met so many people so far, some have been really inspiring, some are not. I&#8217;m embracing the idea of *slow travel* and/or home base travel. I really don&#8217;t care how you travel, but the Eurorail, every capital city for two days is **not** what I want to do. I&#8217;ve learned that already from talking to people and my preconceived values. So far, I&#8217;m on track by only visiting two countries so far, Netherlands and Czech. I&#8217;m really diving into Czech Republic &#8211; mind you, I didn&#8217;t really plan on that but it somehow happened and I&#8217;m very ok with that. However, the bad side of that is that I&#8217;m staying still while people are moving by every 2-5 days. Since the hostel gives a free beer token to every guest, I see new people everyday for just long enough to say the smalltalk &#8211; I haven&#8217;t been in that position before so it&#8217;s new for this computer guy from Minnesota his whole life&#8230; (Self-reflection, yay) Annnyway, I&#8217;m having fun, I&#8217;m enjoying myself, I don&#8217;t like to &#8220;not-work&#8221;, I am forcing myself to take the unbeaten path, I&#8217;m getting more comfortable with myself and my environment, I&#8217;m relaxed, I can go with the flow, I know &#8220;it&#8221; will work out, I drink tea daily, I started to enjoy coffee, I&#8217;m living life, I am balanced. Go me.

As of this writing, I was in Netherlands for 7 days and spent $55usd per day and Czech for 28 days and spent $28usd per day. With my pre-trip expenses, etc, I&#8217;ve spent $65usd per day.

I&#8217;m doing fine, read my [posts][1] about where I&#8217;ve been, look at my pictures on [Flickr][2], interact with me on [Twitter][3] for what I *am* doing, and check back often for what I&#8217;ve *been* doing. Ciao.

(After thought: considering that I&#8217;ve been at (or *lived* at) a dropzone for nearly every weekend this past summer (and the past 6 years), I&#8217;m really missing skydiving. Not going to lie, I can&#8217;t wait to jump out of a plane, most places around me are closing for the winter and I&#8217;m not properly prepared to jump in the cold even if they were open <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> poor planning on my part. I didn&#8217;t think it would be so bad, taking a hiatus, but that sport *is* such a part of my life. I miss it.)
