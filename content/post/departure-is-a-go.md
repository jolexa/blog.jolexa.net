25 hours until I board the plane...

I am excited. So very excited to begin the adventure, to see the world, to assimilate other cultures. Oh, the possibilities.  
I am nervous. Slightly nervous because I am leaving the comfortable safety of &#8220;being home.&#8221;  
I am sad. Mostly sad to leave my family and friends. Of course, I won't be *off the grid*, at all. And, I will be back! *Eventually*. Love you all, thanks for the well wishes!  
I am apprehensive. I think once I land in Amsterdam, it will all fall into place. Until then..uhh, what? Where? I spent many hours down the rathole of tripadvisor last night on the Netherlands.. I can't wait to take locals suggestions on where to go and what to see instead of googling for stuff.  
I am ... Everything. What a mix of thoughts going on..

*Carpe diem.* Here we go.
