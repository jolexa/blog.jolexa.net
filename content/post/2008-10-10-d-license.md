As I previously [wrote][1] about, I just received my D-license yesterday. The D-license is awarded to applicants from the [USPA][2] who have achieved 500 skydives and a couple of other requirements. Anyway, my license number is *D-29580*. That means that I am the **29,580th person** to receive my D license. To put that in contrast, the city of [Minneapolis][3] has **372,833 people** alone. If you take all the people that have received a D-license, there is less than 10% of the population of a major city, and not even the largest major city. Now, it feels like I am in a small community even more. Imagine, walking around in Minneapolis and being able to talk to 1/10 people about skydiving, that would be pretty neat. Now spread those 29,000 across the US and imagine trying to converse in a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sane</span> manor with anyone about the sport of skydiving..

Of course, there is (maybe) more people in the US that skydive that don&#8217;t have 500 jumps yet or they don&#8217;t get their D-license period. However, if there is one license to get, it would be the D because that is the highest one that you can&#8230;so, I don&#8217;t know how many people there are that skydive in the US.

Another tidbit: According to [here][4] at the time of this writing, the US population is ~305,378,753. I am 0.0096863% of the population. Interesting.
