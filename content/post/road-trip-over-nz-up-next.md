My road trip up and down the east coast of Australia ended in August, a fair few weeks ago. I drove 9000 kilometers and spent over $1000 in diesel (yikes). I was on the road for two months. I saw some cool stuff along the way. I basically drove 300-400kms per day and stayed "somewhere" for the night. If I was to do it again, I would go with someone else to split fuel costs and make the driving bits more exciting. I was planning on going farther on the road but some opportunities came up and I didn't trust the van in the outback with hundreds of km's between towns and no cell phone coverage. There is still much to see in Australia but that will have to be another time. So, I ended up back in my home base (Maitland) and worked at the dropzone. Up next is New Zealand, specifically the South Island. I'll be there for a month to ski, speedride, skydive, and sightsee. Excited...YUP. After being in Australia for 6+ months, this is a holiday within a holiday, haha. Then I'll come back to Australia and figure out what's next on the agenda but I can't think that far ahead yet! (Some ideas: Japan to see my cuz, SE Asia, dare I say...homebound (??) )
