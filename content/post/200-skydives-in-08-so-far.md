In response to my [last post][1], I just hit another milestone today..that is 200 jumps in a calendar year. I now have 200 skydives in '08. <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Let me look at my log books and break it down for comparison:

  * **2008:** (so far) 200 skydives
  * **2007:** 199 skydives
  * **2006:** 85 skydives
  * 2004: 19 skydives (not including static-line, training jumps)

It is interesting to note that I was close to 200 last year, but I have had a much better year this year while being around home more often and spending more time with my girlfriend. I think I have struck a very good balance this year and I am very happy about that (not to say that it can't be improved somehow?).

200 is an arbitrary number and has no real meaning, just a round number that is nice to see.
