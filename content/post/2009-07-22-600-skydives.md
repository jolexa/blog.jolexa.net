About a month ago, I hit my **600th skydive**. It wasn&#8217;t anything special per se as the weather was quite sub-optimal that day. *Just* a solo from ~3000 ftÂ  However, it **is** a milestone that should not go unmentioned. This puts me at about 80 jumps for the calendar year and it is below my previous year [numbers][1]. (I blame the overall weather this year.) Hopefully I can pick it up abit towards the latter half of the year. <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Here we go to 700!
