A month on the road isn&#8217;t so bad, eh? So far, I&#8217;ve been living in my van & finding car parks to sleep in by the ocean mostly, it is a tough life! Haha.

Notable so far:

  * In June, I set up camp at [Skydive Ramblers][1] and made 30 skydives over a few weeks. That was fun, good dz there with nice people. It was an awesome break from &#8220;working&#8221; at a dz.
  * Took a short paragliding course at [High Adventure][2] and figured out how to get the wing over my head and run down a slope. You will see the motivation for this below.
  * Ran north to escape the New South Wales rain/cold (winter).

Just today, I spontaneously decided that I was going to drive 500km to Cairns and go for a 3 day scuba liveaboard trip! I made it, though my van tried to stop me. Slight overheating once I got to the tropics. The next 11 days are filled with scuba and skydiving! After that, I&#8217;m not sure where I will go. I&#8217;m leaving for New Zealand on August 29th, the *plan* is to go winter skiing and [speedriding][3]! So excited for that, even though it probably did cut my road trip short. How good is life?!
