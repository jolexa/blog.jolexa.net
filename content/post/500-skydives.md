Woa woa. I just did my 500th skydive on Saturday the 20th. 9/20/08. All I have to say is &#8220;w00t&#8221;!

This particular skydive was very fun. Lynn, Jamie & Marty were on my 500th. It also happened to be Jamie's 800th. Very good timing =) Basically a screw off dive, built a round then we all dropped a knee and spun until we couldn't hold on to eachother. We were then flung around the sky and we sorta rebuilt before breakoff. Me and Marty did some proximity flying under canopy and were about 4 feet away from a 2stack dock. God I love this shit&#8230;
