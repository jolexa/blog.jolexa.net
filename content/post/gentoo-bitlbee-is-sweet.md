I recently moved from using [pidgin][1] to using [bitlbee][2] ([net-im/bitlbee][3]). Bitlebee is sweet because it allows me to access "traditional IM" via [irssi][4] in a screen session from anywhere that I am via my co-located server. Of course, you can use any irc client that you are familiar with. As more and more of my friends move away from traditional IM, I don't feel a need to pay as much attention to the various networks. So, it can stay off my desktop without worries. Do you use bitbee? Any fun tips?
