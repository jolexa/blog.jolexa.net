For years, I&#8217;ve used Google Voice to handle my voicemail instead of the carrier solution. About 4 weeks ago I [ported][1] my cell phone number to Google Voice. Google Voice is just another VOIP carrier that has free SMS/calls to and from numbers in the US. The international [rates][2] seem good too.

Some of my personal pro&#8217;s/con&#8217;s:

  * Simple web interface to use, integrated Google Contacts with my google account. Easy.
  * Voicemail service. Free.
  * Single phone number. Don&#8217;t need to try to get people to use a new number (Have you ever done that? It is a really difficult task)
  * Save $1000/yr by not having a cell phone contract. As alluded to [here][3].

  * I must be around two things to use my phone number: a) computing device, b) wifi
  * Wifi voice calling is somewhat sketchy, I&#8217;m not sure if it is the [app][4] on my iPad or the wifi service? Regardless, I don&#8217;t prefer voice calls anyway. I&#8217;d rather use skype or facetime.
  * If I do get a call, I will probably miss it since I am not &#8220;wearing&#8221; my cell phone anymore. However, I can easily return the call without *too* much latency, if I want.
  * *Slightly* less convenient when trying to meet people and/or finding directions to someplace (need to plan ahead better)

I did [setup][5] a US-based VPN so I&#8217;m guessing that I will be able to use this service outside the US in the near future too. Of course, I can&#8217;t test that scenerio, *yet*.

Overall, I would recommend porting to Google Voice if the above list seems logical to you. If I really needed a better mobile solution (which I don&#8217;t) I would consider getting a pay-as-you-go/prepaid phone which would cost less than half per year and still port my number. I don&#8217;t want to be bound to a contract, and really, I haven&#8217;t yet found why a cell phone is *needed* in these past 4 weeks. I use to think it was crazy to go without a cell phone but now I&#8217;ve changed my *tone*..
