title: Car Accident, sucks!

Well, after 6 years of driving I got into my first car accident with another car. That sucks!

I trying to change lanes and make my exit. I wasn&#8217;t all that close to the car in front of me, but when he decided to basically stop I ended up rear-ending him. =( It was a small SUV (Ford Escape) and the only real damage to my car was the front bumper and the front headlight. My bumper was knocked outta place but still attached, although it now has a nice hole in it from his exhaust. My headlight still works but the inner reflective part is cracked to pieces. Like I said, not much damage. No one was hurt except my wallet now ($600) and probably in the future (insurance).

Bummer. =( =(
