I wrote about how I ended up in Sri Lanka in my last post, [here][1]. I ended up with a GI sickness during my second week, from the a bad meal or water and it spoiled the last week that I was there, but I had my own room, bathroom, a good book, and a resort on the beach. Overall, the first week was fun, teaching English, living in a small village and being immersed in the culture staying with a host family. Hats off to volunteers that can live there long term. I was craving &#8220;western culture&#8221; after a short time. I didn&#8217;t see as much as a wanted to, like the wild elephants, Buddhist temples or surf lessons. There will be other places or times to do that stuff though.
