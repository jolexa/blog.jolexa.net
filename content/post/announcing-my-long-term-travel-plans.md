*It&#8217;s not a fantasy, I realize &#8211; the big dream is actually beginning!*

sab·bat·i·cal /səˈbatikəl/  
Noun:  
any extended period of leave from one&#8217;s customary work, especially for rest, to acquire new skills or training, etc. 

I am writing this because it is not possible to tell EVERYONE that I know in an intimate setting about my travel plans. That is, I&#8217;m embarking on a **Round-the-World** trip starting in October of this year. I&#8217;ve just recently told my workplace, so now I feel ok to *publicly* announce it.

**Who:** Just me. I&#8217;m going solo by choice!  
**What:** &#8220;Round-the-world&#8221; trip aka sabbatical aka career break  
**When:** October 2012 &#8211; October 2013 &#8212; 12 months is the GOAL.  
**Where:** There is no set itinerary. See below.  
**Why:** I have a list of reasons that are motivating me. Some of the reasons are &#8220;why not?&#8221;, &#8220;now is the perfect time&#8221;, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have roots (kids, house, etc)&#8221;  
**How:** To make a long story short, I&#8217;ve been casually thinking of this endeavor for 2+ years. In January 2012, I finally decided that this is the year and made it happen. Then I picked October as a starting date since it seems to be a culmination of a few things, mainly the lease on my apartment is up. Setting a date like that gave me a goal and the rest fell into place.

Everyone always asks me what my plan/itinerary is&#8230; That&#8217;s the fun part, there is **no plan**! There is a *framework* .., roughly: Amsterdam, [Prague][1], &#8230;, Turkey, a stint in [Dubai][2](?), (Singapore?) SE Asia (Thailand seems neat), Japan (want to see my cousin that lives there), South America, USA. However, when looking at that *framework*, once you get past Prague, it is too far out to even think about!

I really look forward to any invitations out there, especially couches and/or tour guides! <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Future posts will be about planning, execution, experiences, and otherwise. More to come later, watch this space&#8230;
