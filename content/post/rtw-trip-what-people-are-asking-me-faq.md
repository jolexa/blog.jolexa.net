Since &#8220;[announcing][1]&#8221; my plans, I&#8217;ve received some of the same questions. Here goes:

**Q: Where are you staying in every country?**  
A: I don&#8217;t care to micro manage every part of the trip. I&#8217;ll figure out where to stay when I get there. I&#8217;ll use overnight trains/planes and sleep while moving. When I get somewhere, I&#8217;ll go have a tea/beer and ask the locals/bartenders where to stay &#8211; it will be great. My other ideas are Couchsurfing (the local Minneapolis community is great, by the way. [My CS Profile][2]), [Airbnb][3] looks like a great resource, and working for lodging also sounds perfectly fine for me. Ever heard of [helpx.net][4]? I&#8217;m a member there too.

**Q: Where are you going?** or **I can&#8217;t believe you don&#8217;t have a plan?!**  
A: Pfft, why does everyone ask about a plan. It is 12 months, people. I am not willing to plan out 12 months of my life right now. Similarly, this is why I did NOT buy a RTW ticket in advance. (See also, &#8216;framework&#8217; in the announcement post) Remember, this isn&#8217;t a *vacation* where I have limited time to see all the *cool things* &#8211; instead, I am embracing slow travel and my idea is to stay at a area/region for 3-4 weeks at a time.

**Q: How are you carrying enough money?**  
A: It is a little known fact, amongst people who ask me, that Capital One does not charge any foreign transaction fees. I&#8217;ll carry some petty cash and use credit card elsewhere. No big deal. Yes, I&#8217;ve already wrote down the numbers to call if the stuff is lost/stolen.

**Q: No phone? International Plan?**  
A: Ah, here we find everyone&#8217;s addiction to cell phones. No, no phone for me. Actually, I&#8217;ve been free from my $1000/year (!!) phone for a few weeks now, I get by just fine without it (ported my number to Google Voice). You know, I only used it for 30 voice minutes (paying for 450) and maybe 500M of data (paying for unlimited) per month anyway. Tell me again, why is that worth $1000/year? I think, at this pace, I&#8217;ll most likely never get a cell again (?).

**Q: Why are you traveling by yourself?**  
A: Thinking back, I&#8217;ve never been super fond of roommates. In my college days, I was the first one to move out of my 5 person house. I live in a studio apartment now. I don&#8217;t want to have to think about the other person&#8217;s needs while making decisions. If I&#8217;m hungry, I go eat. If I WANT to goto that sweet &#8220;place X&#8221;, then I go. Now, this isn&#8217;t to say that I will not find a traveling partner on the road, I&#8217;m super excited to meet other people out there! Also, super excited to meet locals and allow myself to get immersed.

**Q: Where will you work when you get back?** or **How will you survive when you get back?**  
A: Well, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not so sure if I want a computer-related career when I get back. This is one of the catalyst&#8217;s for traveling too. I have a side account of money, at which once I touch it, I know that I need to get back to my support system in the US at first moment. That plan is to not touch that since it will be used to get me *on-my-feet* for a few months.

**Q: What about all your *stuff*?**  
A: Haha, this question is great. People cannot believe that I&#8217;ve (already) sold it all, or otherwise donated/thrown away. I have NO *stuff* to store. It is actually, *extremely* liberating.

I&#8217;m sure I could go on for a while with more FAQ&#8217;s&#8230; All of these questions have been asked by more than one person so please don&#8217;t think that I am singling anyone out. **Any other questions?**
