I never really liked Google ads. I just had them here in the hope that it would pay for a domain registration or two.

  * 15 months of Google Adsense
  * 41,464 Page Impressions
  * 56 clicks
  * $23 dollars of &#8216;revenue'
  * ï»¿56,553 views according to site stats.

So, that is enough. Since I don't like ads on my site, they are now gone. <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
