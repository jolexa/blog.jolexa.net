Well, not really Linux related but I ran across a post today about Open Source Hardware. I guess it makes sense, and it pretty cool. Consider the Linksys WRT54G series, one of Linksys best sellers nowadays because some people discovered it was running embedded Linux. This isn&#8217;t quite the same as OSHardware, but close. Now consider having a profitable company that releases all specs to the microcontroller that they are mass producing, very neat idea. <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Read more [here][1].
