As of writing today, my Android powered phone (Droid X) cannot send SMS messages to some people, but receive messages fine. This is because my address book has &#8220;+1&#8243; on some people&#8217;s numbers.

Solution: Add/edit a number without the &#8220;+1&#8243; &#8211; in a connected world, I don&#8217;t even bother to &#8220;save&#8221; phone numbers, they get synced to me from third party sources (facebook). In this case, synced in such a way that it won&#8217;t work.

By the way, I tried the stock Android SMS program and Handcent SMS, both have the same trouble. Quite a hassle, but such is technology/software. Sigh.
