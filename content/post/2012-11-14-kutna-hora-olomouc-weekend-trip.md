I took a weekend trip to Kutná Hora and Olomouc. Kutná Hora was on the way via train so I got off there (with a small connection train) and visited the Bone Church, a common gravesite of over 40,000 people. I feel like it is one of those things that will just disappear someday &#8211; bones won&#8217;t last forever in the open air like that.

Otherwise, Kutná Hora was just a small town and I didn&#8217;t do much else there besides get on the train again for the city Olomouc (a-la-moats). I probably missed something in Kutná Hora, but it wasn&#8217;t obvious to me and I just heard about the church. Olomouc is the 6th largest city in the Czech Republic, and largely a university town. I stayed in the lovely small hostel, the [Poet&#8217;s Corner][2] (highly recommended), for a few nights. Most students go home on the weekends, which I think is odd, but I did get to talk to some students (from a different city that were home for the weekend) and went out to enjoy the student bars. Good times, I recommend seeing Olomouc if you have a few days open in your itinerary and are not doing the crazy whirlwind capital city Europe tour. There is some nice things to see, I just had to watch the country&#8217;s &#8216;other&#8217; astronomical clock. Also, a few microbreweries, which were delicious, and I even did a beer spa for fun (why not?).
