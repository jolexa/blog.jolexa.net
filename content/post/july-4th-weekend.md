Welcome to my inaugural blog post.

I am home today, relaxing, after an eventful weekend up north in [Twig, MN][1].

Perhaps the funnest thing was on July 4th morning when we went to a nearby town&#8217;s parade which highlighted a drunken clown band at the end. Quite interesting to say the least! (especially, when you have had quite a few drinks yourself before noon! A big &#8220;good job&#8221; goes out to Kel for buying drinks until we were both inebriated).

Then after we took a nap and woke up hungover, we went down to the Lake Superior shore and watched the city of Duluth&#8217;s fireworks show&#8230;pretty good.
