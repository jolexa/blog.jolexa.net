As Linux-Mag points out ([Gentoo Optimizations Benchmarked][1]) using gcc optimizations for "*omg, teh speed*" is not all that practical. Sure, I'll add some compiler flags here and there as long as I am compiling everything anyway but I don't consider that a **feature** of Gentoo Linux.

I actually prefer Gentoo for the package management and customization via USE flags (even with the headaches that they cause sometimes). <img src="http://blog.jolexa.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
