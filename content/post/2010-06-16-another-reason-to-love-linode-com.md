It should be no [secret][1] that this site and my other co-location needs are hosted at [Linode.com][2], for which I am a happy customer running Gentoo Linux.

The reason for this post is that after an [announcement][3] today. All I had to do was reboot and then I received a **42%** RAM increase. Yay.

Thanks Linode, you are exceeding your competition!
