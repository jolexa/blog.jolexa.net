title: Remembering Sept 11.

I know, cliche as this post may be&#8230;I remember all too well where I was on Sept 11th. US History class in 9th grade. Sitting in the desks watching CNN.

I think this is real touching and a very good job by Team Fastrax, a skydiving team of really experienced canopy pilots. Original post can be seen [here][1] on the PD blog. They are jumping at ground zero with 7 US flags of various sizes trailing thier canopies. The plan was to drop all the flags at the same time at approximately 10:30am ET, the time when Twin Tower two fell.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81" title="Jumper with US Flag" src="http://jolexa.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/6a00e54f09e97f883400e55510d8638834-800wi.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="291" />][1]

> The team views this jump as a very special honor and a way to say thank you to the members of all the fire fighters, law enforcement, and military personnel, who have served to protect the freedom that we all enjoy.  
> Below is the list of jumpers and sized flags they will be jumping during this special event.
> 
> Travis Donley – 7800sqft  
> Stuart Schoenfeld – 3700sqft  
> Niklas Hemlin – 2000sqft  
> David Hart – 1100sqft  
> Dan Pangeti – 500sqft  
> David French – 500sqft  
> Robin Heider – 275sqft

Good job guys, times like this that make me proud to be associated with skydiving.
