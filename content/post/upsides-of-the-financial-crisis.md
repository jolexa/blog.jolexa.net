A short list:

  * Cheapest gas since 18 months ago, weee. I just paid **$2.24** (A gallon of milk costs ~**3.29**)
  * The housing market will still be in a slump when I am looking to buy a place next summer. Yay, real estate will be on sale.
  * GREAT time to invest for a young, 22 year-old like me. I&#8217;m trying to pour money into the market now.
  * The stock market will come back, it always [does][1].
