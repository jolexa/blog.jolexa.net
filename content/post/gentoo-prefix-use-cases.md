(I write this because I have talked [quite a few times][1] about the subject but never offered any use cases for it.)

We have a core group of [Gentoo Prefix][2] users in #gentoo-prefix on freenode. I took a poll and gathered up all the use cases for Gentoo Prefix. They are in somewhat of an order:

  * Bringing a Gentoo userland to your MacBook (macos/darwin) -- without modifying the <del>eye-candy</del> host OS.
  * Allowing easy package management on your host where you do not have privileged access.Â  No more manual `./configure --prefix=~/foo && make && make install`
  * GNU-ifying your non-GNU host, like Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, etc. (userland only, of course)
  * Providing a similar environment across distros for your simulated build/customer environment.
  * Using the familiar Gentoo/Portage on a non familiar OS
  * "I use Gentoo Prefix because it is cool" -grobian

For a more detailed use-case analysis on some of the points above, please [read here][3]. Otherwise, enjoy!
