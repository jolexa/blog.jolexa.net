*(I'd like to first give a global shout out to my first Crossfit home, [The Athlete Lab][1])*

Since I'm in Prague for a [month][3], I became a member of [Crossfit Praha][4] instead of just being a drop-in client. The gym is quite small, but centrally located in Prague. The lifting days are separate than the normal days (probably unless you are a trusted regular). The premise is, you show up during a block of time, warm up on your own, proceed with WOD, then cool down on your own which is pretty standard across gyms from what I can tell, exception being that everyone is starting the WOD at their own time (not structured times). Now I've put my money where my mouth is and have to keep a good diet, drink not so much beer, etc to be able to function the next day(s) after a WOD. &#8220;Tomorrow will not be any easier&#8221;
