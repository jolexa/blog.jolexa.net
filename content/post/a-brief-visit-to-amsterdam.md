I was in Amsterdam for 3 days and 2 nights. My first impressions were quite interesting. The culture in Amsterdam is quite liberal and relaxed, but it is also regulated. This was my first stop in my [RTW trip][1]. As my first stop, it was a great place to be *dropped in* to Europe. It allowed me to get into the Euro mindset and figure out what the heck I was doing. Now I know when I get into a city I need to do the following: 1) goto tourist info building to find a city map, 2) physically find my sleeping accommodations, 3) set my bag down and go explore the city with my map.

Amsterdam is a very old city with much history and architecture. You can look at my pics on [flickr][2], I have left comments on most of them. I liked all the canals that the city is built around, quite unique. Overall, glad I went there but probably not the city for me. I did not fall in love with it.
