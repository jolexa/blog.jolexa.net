Hi,

News item: The kerberos USE flag has been removed from the default desktop profiles. If you relied on this use flag (unlikely) then you should add it to make.conf again. There was discussion about this flag and its validity when the e2fsprogs-libs upgrade was happening on the stable tree. Anyway, it is now removed.
