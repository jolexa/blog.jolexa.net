I knew the general concept of this word but it was thrown around today so I decided to research it.

> **Parkinson's Law of Triviality** (also known as the **bicycle shed** example, and by the expression **colour of the bikeshed**) is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that organisations give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. [source][1]

Made famous in software development by Poul-Henning Kamp (FreeBSD dev)

> *"The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change." *[source][2]

Seems to be true to me. We shouldn't needlessly argue about trivial details.

I leave you with this..Is there a software development group in existence that does not bikeshed?:

> **Futile investment of time and energy in marginal technical issues, often including annoying propaganda.** (as defined by [Wiktionary][3])

I doubt it, but is it always a bad thing? Comments?
