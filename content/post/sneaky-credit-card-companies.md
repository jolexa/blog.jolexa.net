So, you know those &#8220;gift cards&#8221; that are made by Visa/AMEX/MasterCard and can be used anywhere? Well..they are sneaky, here is why. You must have a balance on the card that covers the cost you are trying to purchase! Otherwise it is &#8216;denied&#8217; like a credit card is. This is real annoying when you have less than a dollar on the card and you can&#8217;t use it anywhere! Money down the drain for me and making money for them. grr. **Buyer Beware** &#8211; I would much rather receive a gift card to a specific store and actually be able to use all of it, wouldn&#8217;t you?
