The [Gentoo Miniconf][1] is over now but it was a great success. There was 30+ developers that went and I met quite some users too. Thanks to Theo (tampakrap) and Michal (miska) for organizing the event (and others), thanks to [openSUSE][2] for sponsoring and letting the Gentoo Linux guys hangout there. Thanks to the other sponsors too, Google, Aeroaccess, et al.

More pics at the [Google+ event][3] page.

It was excellent to meet all of you.
